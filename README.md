# ADR-Website-JS
Js scripts for the ADR website.
This repo is to keep track of changes and additions made to the ADR company SEO project i am spearheading. Most of these JS scripts are running inline
leveraging the code-block element of the wordpress Oxygen Builder.

Mostly just some DOM manipulation and conditional logic. Hopefully extending functionality in the future

update 5/19: added in some PHP scripting to pull data off the db table i created in our WP host. Pulling data to dynamically load content on page 
depending on query string.

To see these scripts in action here are a couple of handy links:
